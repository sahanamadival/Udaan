## 📌 Important Paths & Fonts
- 🈵 **Hindi PDFs:** `Noto Sans Devanagari` (`project/Noto_Sans_Devanagari/`)
  - Ensure `NotoSansDevanagari-Regular.ttf` exists
- 📂 **Translations:** `project/static/translations/`
- 🔊 **Narrations:** `project/static/narrations/`

---

## 🔒 Security Notes
- Set a strong `app.secret_key` in production
- Never commit `.env` with real keys
- Validate & sanitize uploads; limit file size and content type

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
- **Tesseract not found:** Update path in `app.py`, confirm `tesseract.exe` works in terminal
- **pdf2image errors on Windows:** Install Poppler & add `bin` to PATH
- **Gemini errors:** Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` & network/proxy
- **Missing fonts:** Ensure `NotoSansDevanagari-Regular.ttf` exists

---

## 🌟 Extending
- Replace placeholder charts with JS chart library (Chart.js)
- Add per-student pages & deeper analytics
- Persist dyslexic reader preferences via localStorage
- Add server-side MP3 generation (currently pyttsx3 is client-side)

---

## 📝 Notes
- Default `app.secret_key` is for development only; set a secure key in production
- File uploads: Consider limiting size and validating content type to avoid misuse
- Fonts & translations: Ensure Noto Sans Devanagari is present to avoid broken Hindi PDFs
